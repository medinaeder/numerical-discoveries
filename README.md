Numerical Experiments and derivations
A place where I dump all my numerical analysis questions and experiments. 

Some examples include:

- What happens when you have perform a least squares fit on data whose output is not unique. 

- In MG: What do Coarse Grid Correction opertator eigenvalues look like for a standard poisson problem? Do we always need to smoothen prior to doing a CGC?
